Using latest LiDAR compatible devices from Apple, explore and capture your surrounding in a new way! 
Open Model in PLY/XYZ/STL/OBJ/VTK format, or export your captures in these.


The app is on progress and using a C++ library that was not made for mobile device, there is a lot of constraints with memory and as such it might crash. Please bear with me as I'm working on these. In the meantime please enjoy this free tool, I hope it can be of some use for you.
